# Comprehensive Team Management Enhancement Plan

## Project Overview

This document outlines the complete plan for enhancing the team management system in the ThoughtSpace application. The goal is to create a beautiful, production-ready team management interface that provides comprehensive functionality for team creation, member management, invitations, and administrative controls.

## Current State Analysis

### Database Schema (Current)
- `teams` table with basic team info (id, name, created_by, timestamps)
- `team_members` table with user-team relationships and roles (owner/member)
- `profiles` table with user information
- RLS policies implemented for security

### Current UI Limitations
- Basic team selection interface
- Limited team management capabilities
- No invitation system
- No member management features
- No visual indicators for team status

## Enhanced Design Vision

### Design Principles
- **Beautiful & Modern**: Apple-level design aesthetics with attention to detail
- **Production-Ready**: Fully featured with comprehensive error handling
- **Intuitive UX**: Clear visual hierarchy and user-friendly interactions
- **Responsive**: Works seamlessly across all device sizes
- **Accessible**: Proper accessibility labels and navigation

### Visual Design Concept
- **Card-Based Layout**: Modern card design with subtle shadows and rounded corners
- **Color-Coded Status**: Visual indicators for different team states
- **Smooth Animations**: Micro-interactions and transitions using react-native-reanimated
- **Contextual Actions**: Smart action buttons based on user permissions
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Expandable sections to manage complexity

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Database Schema Updates

#### 1.1 Add Invitation System
- [ ] Add `invitation_status` field to `team_members` table
  - Values: 'pending', 'accepted', 'declined'
  - Default: 'pending' for new invitations
- [ ] Update RLS policies for invitation workflows
- [ ] Add database indexes for performance optimization

#### 1.2 Enhanced Team Metadata
- [ ] Add `description` field to teams table (optional)
- [ ] Add `avatar_url` field for team avatars
- [ ] Add `member_limit` field for team size restrictions

#### 1.3 Migration Strategy
```sql
-- Add invitation status to team_members
ALTER TABLE team_members ADD COLUMN invitation_status TEXT DEFAULT 'accepted';
ALTER TABLE team_members ADD CONSTRAINT invitation_status_check 
  CHECK (invitation_status IN ('pending', 'accepted', 'declined'));

-- Add team metadata
ALTER TABLE teams ADD COLUMN description TEXT;
ALTER TABLE teams ADD COLUMN avatar_url TEXT;
ALTER TABLE teams ADD COLUMN member_limit INTEGER DEFAULT 50;

-- Update indexes
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_team_members_invitation_status 
  ON team_members(invitation_status);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_team_members_composite
