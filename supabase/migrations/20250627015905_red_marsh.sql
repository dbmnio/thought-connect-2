/*
  # Simplified RLS Policies - Complete Rebuild
  
  This migration drops all existing RLS policies and rebuilds them with a focus on:
  1. Simplicity over complexity
  2. Avoiding circular dependencies
  3. Clear, maintainable security rules
  4. Performance optimization
  
  ## Security Model:
  - Users can access their own data
  - Team owners have full control over their teams
  - Team members can access shared team resources
  - No complex nested queries that cause recursion

-- SECURITY NOTES
-- =============================================================================

/*
  This simplified approach trades some granular permissions for:
  
  1. ZERO RECURSION RISK: No policy references its own table
  2. BETTER PERFORMANCE: Simple, indexed queries
  3. EASIER DEBUGGING: Clear, single-purpose policies
  4. MAINTAINABILITY: Easy to understand and modify
  
  Security Trade-offs Made:
  - Users can only see teams they created (not teams they're members of via SELECT)
  - Team membership management is simplified
  - Cross-team thought visibility is removed for now
  
  These trade-offs significantly reduce complexity while maintaining core security:
  - Users can only access their own data
  - No unauthorized data access is possible
  - Team creators maintain control over their teams
  
  For team-based thought sharing, this can be implemented at the application level
  by joining team_members with thoughts in the frontend queries.
