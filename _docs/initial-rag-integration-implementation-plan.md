Using @project-overview-3.md , can you come up with a plan to implement the following feature?

Whenever a user submits a thought (an image, or an audio snippet later), we want to use openAI to create a detailed concise description of the thought, store the description in the thoughts table, and generate a vector embedding using opanAI.  We want to store that embedding into the thoughts table, and also use supabase's pgvector extensions to be able to have thoughts indexed by the embedding.

When creating the plan, decide whether to use langchain, or langsmith, or neither, and explain your rationale.

Design the architecture such that, if there are issues doing this synchronously, we can do the following refactor: put embedding jobs on a distributed queue for processing later

Do not write code

### Technology Choice: LangChain, LangSmith, or Neither?

For this feature, I recommend **neither LangChain nor LangSmith** for the initial implementation.

-   **Rationale:** The required workflow is straightforward: take an image, call an OpenAI API to get a description, then take that description and call another OpenAI API to get an embedding. This involves two distinct, linear API calls.
    -   Using the official `openai` Node.js library directly within a Supabase Edge Function will be more transparent, easier to debug, and avoids adding an extra layer of abstraction (LangChain) for a task that doesn't require complex chaining or agentic behavior.
    -   LangSmith is an excellent observability tool, but it's best introduced once the core feature is operational and you need to diagnose issues with prompt performance or trace complex chains, which we don't have yet.
-   **Conclusion:** Starting with direct API calls keeps the implementation clean and dependencies minimal, while leaving the door open to integrate these tools later if the AI logic becomes more complex.

### Implementation Plan

The proposed architecture uses a **Supabase Edge Function** to handle the AI processing. This keeps your OpenAI API key secure on the server-side and prevents the user's app from freezing while waiting for API responses. The client application will create the thought and then asynchronously trigger this function, updating the UI reactively based on status changes from Supabase Realtime.

#### Phase 1: Database Schema Modifications

- [x] Enable `pgvector` Extension.
- [x] Alter the `thoughts` Table:
    - [x] Add `ai_description` (type: `text`, nullable: `true`)
    - [x] Add `embedding` (type: `vector(1536)`, nullable: `true`). The dimension `1536` corresponds to OpenAI's `text-embedding-3-small` model.
    - [x] Add `embedding_status` (type: `text`, default: `'pending'`). Possible values: `pending`, `processing`, `completed`, `failed`.
- [x] Create a Vector Index on the `embedding` column.

#### Phase 2: Server-Side AI Processing (Edge Function)

- [x] Create New Edge Function: `generate-thought-embedding`.
- [x] Secure Environment Variables: `OPENAI_API_KEY`. (This is a manual step for the user in Supabase Studio)
- [x] Function Logic:
    - [x] Triggered by POST with `thought_id`.
    - [x] Use admin client.
    - [x] Update `embedding_status` to `'processing'`.
    - [x] Fetch image from Storage.
    - [x] Generate description with GPT-4 Vision.
    - [x] Generate embedding with Embeddings API.
    - [x] Update thought with `ai_description`, `embedding`, and `embedding_status` to `'completed'`.
    - [x] Error handling: update `embedding_status` to `'failed'`.

#### Phase 3: Client-Side Integration

- [x] Modify `useThoughts.ts`:
    - [x] In `createThought`, after insert, get new `thought_id`.
    - [x] Asynchronously call `generate-thought-embedding` Edge Function with `thought_id`.
- [x] Implement Realtime UI Feedback:
    - [x] Use Supabase Realtime in `useThoughts` to listen for changes on `thoughts` table.
    - [x] Update UI based on `embedding_status` (`pending`/`processing` -> spinner, `completed` -> normal, `failed` -> error/retry).

### Implementation Notes (Post-Implementation)

*   **Image Data Format:** It was clarified that the `image_url` column in the `thoughts` table stores images as base64-encoded data URIs (e.g., `data:image/png;base64,...`) and not as publicly accessible URLs to files in Supabase Storage.
*   **Edge Function Compatibility:** The `generate-thought-embedding` Edge Function was reviewed in light of this information. The implementation was found to be correct without any changes.
*   **Rationale:** The OpenAI GPT-4 Vision API, when using the `image_url` content block, accepts a `url` property that can be either a standard web URL or a base64-encoded data URI. Since our code passes the `image_url` value directly to this property, it correctly handles the data URI format. No pre-processing or URL generation is necessary.
